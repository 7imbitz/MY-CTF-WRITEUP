__PROBLEM__

Get flag3

__HINT__

Find flag3 on the host and submit the the whole content of it.

__ANSWER__

apparently i cant read flag3.txt as shell user, so i tried ssh with user john and password justin at ip 192.168.0.10 and i got the flag.

```
john@hydrogrencorp:~$ cat flag3.txt
flag{b4270e25c9fadba2b79e18055141d882}
```
